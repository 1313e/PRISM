What OS are supported?
----------------------
*PRISM* should be compatible with all Windows, MacOS and UNIX-based machines, as long as they support one of the required Python versions.
Compatibility is currently tested for Linux 16.04 (Xenial) using `Travis CI`_ and Windows 32-bit/64-bit using `AppVeyor`_.
MacOS is not explicitly tested for, which may be added in the future, but *PRISM* should be compatible with it.
