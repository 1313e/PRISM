How do I contribute?
--------------------
Contributing to *PRISM* is done through pull requests in the `repository`_.
If you have an idea on what to contribute, it is recommended to open a `GitHub issue`_ about it, such that the maintainers can give their advice or help.
If you want to contribute but do not really know what, then you can take a look at the ToDos that are scattered throughout the code.
When making a contribution, please keep in mind that it must be compatible with all Python versions that *PRISM* supports (|Python|), and preferably with all operating systems as well.

What OS are supported?

*PRISM* should be compatible with all Windows, MacOS and UNIX-based machines, as long as they support one of the required Python versions.
Compatibility is currently tested for Linux 16.04 (Xenial) using `Travis CI`_ and Windows 32-bit/64-bit using `AppVeyor`_.
MacOS is not explicitly tested for, which may be added in the future, but *PRISM* should be compatible with it.
