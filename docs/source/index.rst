============================================================================================

This is the documentation for the *PRISM* package, an efficient and rapid alternative to MCMC methods for optimizing and analyzing scientific models.
*PRISM* was made by **Ellert van der Velden** as part of a Ph.D under supervision of `A/Prof. Alan Duffy`_ at `Swinburne University of Technology`_.
It is written in pure `Python 2/3`_ and `publicly available on GitHub`_.
