PRISM Parameters File Descriptions:
n_sam_init (500)		: Number of model evaluation samples that is used to construct the first iteration of the emulator system.
				  This value must be a positive integer.

proj_res (15)			: Number of emulator evaluation samples that is used to generate the grid for the projection figures (it defines the resolution of the projection).
				  This value must be a positive integer.

proj_depth (150)		: Number of emulator evaluation samples that is used to generate the samples in every projected grid point (it defines the accuracy/depth of the projection).
				  This value must be a positive integer.

base_eval_sam (800)		: Base number of emulator evaluation samples that is used to analyze an iteration of the emulator system.
				  It is multiplied by the iteration number and the number of model parameters to generate the true number of emulator evaluations, in order to ensure an increase in emulator accuracy.
				  This value must be a positive integer.

sigma (0.8)			: The Gaussian sigma/standard deviation that is used when determining the Gaussian contribution to the overall emulator variance.
				  This value is only required when `method` == 'gaussian', as the Gaussian sigma is obtained from the residual variance left after the regression optimization if regression is included.
				  This value must be non-zero.

l_corr (0.3)			: The amplitude of the Gaussian correlation length.
				  This number is multiplied by the difference between the upper and lower value boundaries of the model parameters to obtain the Gaussian correlation length for every model parameter.
				  This value must be positive.

impl_cut ([0.0, 4.0, 3.8, 3.5])	: A list of implausibility cut-off values that specifies the maximum implausibility values a parameter set is allowed to have to be considered 'plausible'.
				  A zero can be used as a filler value, either taking on the preceding value or acting as a wildcard if the preceding value is a wildcard or non-existent.
				  Zeros are appended at the end of the list if the length is less than the number of comparison data points, while extra values are ignored if the length is more.
				  This must be a sorted list of positive values (excluding zeros).

criterion ('multi')		: The criterion to use for determining the quality of the LHDs that are used, represented by an integer, float, string or *None*.
				  This parameter is the only non-PRISM parameter. Instead, it is used in the lhd()-function of the e13Tools package.
				  By default, 'multi' is used to give equal priority to maximizing minimum distances and minimizing the maximum correlation between pair-wise samples.

method ('full')			: The method to use for constructing the emulator systems.
				  'gaussian' will only include Gaussian processes (no regression), which is much faster, but also less accurate.
				  'regression' will only include regression processes (no Gaussian), which is more accurate than Gaussian only, but underestimates the emulator variance by multiple orders of magnitude.
				  'full' includes both Gaussian and regression processes, which is slower than Gaussian only, but by far the most accurate both in terms of expectation and variance values.

				  'gaussian' can be used for faster exploration especially for simple models.
				  'regression' should only be used when the polynomial representation of a model is important and enough model realizations are available.
				  'full' should be used by default.

use_regr_cov (False)		: Whether or not the regression variance should be taken into account for the variance calculations.
				  The regression variance is the variance on the regression process itself and is only significant if a low number of model realizations is used to construct the emulator systems.
				  Including it usually only has a very small effect on the overall variance value, while it can slow down the emulator evaluation rate by as much as a factor of 3.
				  This value is not required if `method` == 'gaussian' and is automatically set to *True* if `method` == 'regression'.
				  This value must be a bool.

poly_order (3)			: Up to which order all polynomial terms of all model parameters should be included in the active parameters and regression processes.
				  This value is not required if `method` == 'gaussian' and `do_active_anal` == *False*.
				  This value must be a positive integer.

do_active_anal (True)		: Whether or not an active parameters analysis must be carried out for every iteration of every emulator system.
				  If *False*, all potentially active parameters listed in `pot_active_par` will be active.
				  This value must be a bool.

freeze_active_par (True)	: Whether or not active parameters should be frozen in their active state.
				  If *True*, parameters that have been considered active in a previous iteration of an emulator system, will automatically be active again (and skip any active parameters analysis).
				  This value must be a bool.

pot_active_par (None)		: A list of parameter names that indicate which parameters are potentially active.
				  Potentially active parameters are the only parameters that will enter the active parameters analysis (or will all be active if `do_active_anal` == *False*).
				  Therefore, all parameters not listed will never be considered active.
				  If all parameters should be potentially active, then a *None* can be given.
				  This must either be a list of parameter names or *None*.

use_mock (False)		: Whether or not mock data must be used as comparison data when constructing a new emulator system.
				  When using mock data for an emulator system, it is not possible to change the comparison data in later emulator iterations.
				  This value must be a bool.


PRISM Usage Notes:
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept a bool (*True*/*False*) also accept 0/1 as a valid input;
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept *None* indicate a default value or operation for obtaining this input argument.
  In most of these cases, the default value depends on the current state of the PRISM pipeline, and therefore a small operation is required for obtaining this value.
  An example is providing *None* to the `pot_active_par`-parameter, where it indicates that all model parameters should be potentially active;
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept the names of model parameters also accept the internal indices of these model parameters.
  The index is the order in which the parameter names appear in the `par_name` list of the ModelLink class or as they appear in the output of the details()-method of the Pipeline class.
- Depending on the used emulator type, state of loaded emulator system and the PRISM parameter values, it is possible that providing values for certain PRISM parameters has no influence on the outcome of the pipeline.
  This can be either because they have non-changeable default values or are simply not used anywhere (given the current state of the pipeline).
  An example of this is when `method` != 'gaussian', which causes the `sigma`-parameter to have no use in the pipeline.
  An other example is switching the bool value for the `use_mock`-parameter while loading a constructed emulator system, since the mock data is generated (or not) when constructing a new emulator system and cannot be changed or swapped out afterward;


Quote to remember:
"These self-contained enhancements to PRISM can offer a
significant benefit to a range of science disciplines as all research utilises models, and few
can afford the computational resources to truly map and explore theirs."
