PRISM Terminology:
------------------
- Analysis: The process of evaluating a set of emulator evaluation samples in the emulator and performing an implausibility check on them;
- Construction: The process of calculating all necessary components to describe an iteration of the emulator;
- Emulator system: The emulated version of a single model output/comparison data point in a single iteration;
- Emulator: The collection of all emulator systems together;
- (Emulator) Iteration: A single, specified step in the construction of the emulator;
- Projection: An analysis carried out on a specific set of active parameters for an iteration to determine the correlation between the two parameters;
- Projection figure: The visual representation of a projection;
- Parameter set: A single combination/set of model parameter values, used to evaluate the emulator/model once;
- Sample: Same as a parameter set;
- Sample set: A set of samples;
- Evaluation set: Same as sample set;
- Model realization samples: The sample set (to be) used for evaluating the model;
- Model evaluation samples: Same as model realization samples;
- Model outputs/realizations: The model output corresponding to a set of model realization/evaluation samples;
- Emulator evaluation samples: The sample set (to be) used for evaluating the emulator;
- Plausible samples: A subset of a set of emulator evaluation samples that satisfied the implausibility checks;
- External model realization set: A set of externally calculated and provided model realization samples and their outputs;
- Active parameters: The set of model parameters that are considered to have significant influence on the output of the model and have at least one polynomial term in the regression function;
- Passive parameters: The set of model parameters that are not considered active, and therefore are considered to not have a significant influence on the output of the model;
- Potentially active parameters: A user-provided set of model parameters that are allowed to become active. Any model parameter that is not potentially active will never become active, even if it should;
- Frozen (active) parameters: The set of model parameters that, once considered active, will always stay active, even if they should not;
- Regression: The process of determining the important polynomial terms of the active parameters and their coefficients, by using a least-squares fitting;
- Covariance matrix: The matrix of prior covariances between all model realization samples and itself;
- Prior expectation: The expectation value of a parameter set as determined by the emulator system, without taking the adjustment term (from the BLA) into account. This value is zero if regression is not used;
- Prior covariance: The covariance value between two parameter sets as determined by the emulator system;
- Prior variance: The variance value of a parameter set as determined by the emulator system, without taking the adjustment term (from the BLA) into account;
- Adjusted expectation: The prior expectation of a parameter set, with the adjustment term taken into account;
- Adjusted covariance: The prior variance of a parameter set, with the adjustment term taken into account;
- Adjustment term: The extra term (as determined by the BLA) that is added to the prior expectation and variance values that describes all correlation between model realization samples;
- Implausibility value: The number of sigmas the emulator system expects the model output corresponding to a given parameter set, to be away from the data point it is compared against;
- Mock data: The set of comparison data points that has been generated by evaluating the model for a random parameter set and perturbing the output by the model discrepancy variance.


PRISM General Parameter Names:
------------------------------
- emul_i: The specific emulator iteration to use;
- emul_s: The specific emulator system (in the given emul_i) to use;
- emul_s_seq: A sequence of emul_s values;


PRISM Usage Notes:
------------------
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept a bool (*True*/*False*) also accept 0/1 as a valid input;
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept *None* indicate a default value or operation for obtaining this input argument.
  In most of these cases, the default value depends on the current state of the PRISM pipeline, and therefore a small operation is required for obtaining this value.
  An example is providing *None* to the `pot_active_par`-parameter, where it indicates that all model parameters should be potentially active;
- Unless specified otherwise, all input arguments in the PRISM package that accept the names of model parameters also accept the internal indices of these model parameters.
  The index is the order in which the parameter names appear in the `par_name` list of the ModelLink class or as they appear in the output of the details()-method of the Pipeline class.
- Depending on the used emulator type, state of loaded emulator system and the PRISM parameter values, it is possible that providing values for certain PRISM parameters has no influence on the outcome of the pipeline.
  This can be either because they have non-changeable default values or are simply not used anywhere (given the current state of the pipeline).
  An example of this is when `method` != 'gaussian', which causes the `sigma`-parameter to have no use in the pipeline.
  An other example is switching the bool value for the `use_mock`-parameter while loading a constructed emulator system, since the mock data is generated (or not) when constructing a new emulator system and cannot be changed or swapped out afterward;
- All docstrings in PRISM are written in RTF (Rich Text Format) and therefore best viewed in an editor that supports it (like Spyder).

Quote to remember:
------------------
"These self-contained enhancements to PRISM can offer a significant benefit to a range of science disciplines as all research utilizes models, and few can afford the computational resources to truly map and explore theirs."
