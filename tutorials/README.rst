PRISM tutorials
===============
This directory contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that serve as tutorals for the *PRISM* package.

Getting started
---------------
In order to use these tutorials, one first has to make sure that *PRISM* is already installed.
After this, one has to clone the `repository`_, install the `requirements_tutorials`_ and launch Jupyter::

    $ git clone https://github.com/1313e/PRISM
    $ cd PRISM/tutorials
    $ pip install -r requirements_tutorials.txt
    $ jupyter lab

If *PRISM* was installed by cloning the repository instead of using ``pip``, one can skip the first step and directly go to the directory containing the tutorials.
