This directory contains several (test) scripts (and their data files) that I (1313e) use for running PRISM.
I have documented them to allow others to know what the steps do.
Most of the test scripts cannot be executed with just PRISM, but will require external sources as well (with the imagine scripts requiring IMAGINE and the meraxes scripts requiring a very specific branch of both meraxes and mhysa).
I put them here to give others an idea off how to build up/create a script for running PRISM.
The 'test_sine_wave.py' script should run without any problems (given that the ModelLink and model for it are provided with PRISM).
One can play around with this script to see the workings of PRISM.
